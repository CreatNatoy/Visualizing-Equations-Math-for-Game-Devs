* Dot product
* Cross product

## Dot product
Dot product can be used to determine if there is an object in front of you or not. <br>
Dot product > 0, yes, it's in front of you. 
Dot product < 0, no, it's in behind of you.  

` SeeForward ` - represents the vector pointing in the player's forward direction.

## Cross product
The cross product is a mathematical operation applied on two input vectors that returns a perpendicular vector in relation to the two input vectors.
In this example, you can determine where the enemy is on the right or on the left. using the Y cross product value. you can also determine whether it is from the top or from the bottom using the X cross product value.

` SeeForward ` - represents the vector pointing in the player's forward direction. <br>
` Green vector ` - represents the vector pointing in the player to enemy direction. <br>
` Bluee vector ` - represents the vector pointing the cross product. <br>
